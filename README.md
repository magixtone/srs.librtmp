srs.librtmp
===========

The client library srs-librtmp of SRS(https://github.com/ossrs/srs)

This repository is exported by SRS2.0+, please read the wiki(
[CN](https://github.com/ossrs/srs/wiki/v2_CN_SrsLibrtmp#export-srs-librtmp),
[EN](https://github.com/ossrs/srs/wiki/v2_EN_SrsLibrtmp#export-srs-librtmp)
).

When you program on linux, the exported project or files can be direclty used.

For windows, I provides a visual studio project example.

We also patch the [librtmp](https://github.com/ossrs/librtmp) to work better with SRS,
to get the debug srs ip/pid/cid, which is very important to fast debug.
